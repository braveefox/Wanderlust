/*
  For a production website, it's crucial to set up Tailwind CSS with a build tool like PostCSS.
  This enables "purging," which scans your HTML and JS files to remove all unused CSS classes.
  Doing so will reduce the final CSS file size from ~3MB to just a few kilobytes,
  dramatically improving your site's load time.
